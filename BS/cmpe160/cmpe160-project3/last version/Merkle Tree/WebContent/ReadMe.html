	<h2>Packages</h2>
	<p>It is important for you to understand package types. There are
		three types of packages:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>
			<b>Changeable</b>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			You can change the files in these packages. Note that the regions
			that you are allowed to change are restricted. <i>Make sure that
				you change only the regions that are marked.</i> <br>For example
			<code>question</code>
			package.
		</dd>
		<dt>
			<b>Usable</b>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			You can use them, but you should not change them. During grading,
			these files are replaced with the originals. Therefore, any change
			that you made will be lost. When this replacement is done, your code
			may not compile or may not work as intended although during exam,
			i.e., with your modifications, it could have been working. <br>For
			example
			<code>do_not_modify</code>
			package.
		</dd>
		<dt>
			<b>ForYourEyesOnly</b>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			These are the packages that contain files to help you such as open
			book material or "cheat sheets". You are free to benefit from them
			but you should not change or refer them in your solutions because
			these files will be removed before grading. Since they are
			unavailable during grading, any dependency on these packages will
			cause your code not to compile/run. <br>For example
			<code>openbook</code>
			package.
		</dd>
	</dl>

	<h2>Modification</h2>

	<ol>
		<li>All your modifications must be between the markers:<br>
			<code>// YOUR_EDIT_STARTS_BELOW_THIS_LINE</code><br> <code>
				// YOUR_EDIT_ENDS_ABOVE_THIS_LINE</code><br> All changes made in other
			places will be lost.
		</li>
		<li>If you modify/delete the markers, we will not be able to
			extract your answer, and you may receive zero. <font color="red"><b>SO,
					DON'T TOUCH THE MARKERS.</b></font>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Testing during exam</h2>
	You are given a test suit to check your code in
	<code>codes.teaching.testing.student</code>
	package under the "testing" folder. We recommend that you use this test
	suite during the exam/quiz. It will give you a sense of what is
	expected.
	<ul>
		<li>Run <code>codes.teaching.testing.student.ExamJUnitCases</code>
			as JUnit.
		</li>
		<li>Make modifications so that your code passes one test at a
			time. Then, modify your code to pass one more test.</li>
		<li>Submit your code each time it passes one more test case so
			that your last submission has a running and relatively better code.</li>
		<li>However, note that these test cases do not cover all possible
			cases to be used in grading.</li>
		<li>These test cases are not used as it is during grading but
			similar test are. So, passing these test does not guarantee to get
			full score in the exam.</li>
		<li>There may be additional test cases that we expect you to
			think about.</li>
		<li>If you are through with the test cases, you are welcome to
			add new test cases.</li>
		<li>Note that the content of <code>codes.teaching.testing.student</code>
			package will not be used in grading.
		</li>

	</ul>
	<h2>Submission</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>We will grade only your <i>last</i> submission before the
			deadline. All submissions after the deadline will be simply ignored.
		</li>
		<li>Make sure your code compiles before you submit.</li>
		<li>It is recommended that you submit your code every time you
			pass a new test case.</li>
	</ul>
