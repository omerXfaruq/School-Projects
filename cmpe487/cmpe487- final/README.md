# Transporter ~ LAN video/group video chat, text chat application

_Collaborated with @srknzl_

* Use this application with ethernet in order to get good video and audio quality, this application is not intended for wifi. We tried optimizing wifi but due to packet losses we could not achive it.   
* How to use:
    * You can send message, start 1-1 video chat and attend to group video chats. In order to attend a group video chat you need to enter a group. Groups are stored locally so that when you quit the application your groups do not disappear.
    * In order to create or enter a group press 6 "Manage groups" in the main menu, then press enter 3 "enter/create a group", enter a name that is alphanumeric. That's it. 
    * You can see all the groups that are created by using all groups option in manage group options.
    * Once you are in a group you can attend a video chat in that group. 

* Note related to group storage:

    * Groups folder holds the currently attended groups. So please do not put a folder called groups in the same folder with main.py in order the application to work properly. 

## To run the program run main.py with python3
## 1.1. Dependencies
